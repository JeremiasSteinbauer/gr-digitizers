       * \brief The block returns the response from lower frequency to the upper frequency.
       * Where:
       * lower frequency = center_fq - 0.5 * width_f,
       * upper frequency = center_fq + 0.5 * width_fq,
       * for each given pair of frequencies. The user also needs to specify the
       * time_of_transition, which tells the block how many seconds each transition from the
       * user specified windows should take. The block holds the last frequency window,
       * until a beam in tag arrives. When it does, it starts changing its frequency window,
       * corresponding to the parameters set.
       * Graphical representation for this:
